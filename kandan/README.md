# Kandan: A language learning web app

Project completed for the Hanyang ERICA Software Capstone project fair 2023.
We created a translator/flashcard web app using React, Google Firebase and the LibreTranslate API. Users can save translations as flashcards to study later, manualy create flashcards, filter flashcards to study by language and make use of our spaced repetition algorithm.
